This project contains the code for a Lucky Vending Machine is to simulate a physical vending machine commonly found in shopping malls, where a player inserts some coins, pulls a handle and wins a random prize (or no prize).

The program will display a menu which allows the player to select various options to simulate the various vending machine operations. The "prizes" are decided by the computer (the vending machine) generating a random number between 1-5, with each number representing a particular prize (see prize table in the Program Logic section below). 

To "win" a prize, the player will need to guess correctly the number generated by the computer. The prizes are worth between $10-50, and each guess will cost the player between $1-5.

Each time the player chooses to play (ie. doing a "Guess A Prize"), he** is charged between $1-5, depending on what he wants to win (see Prize Table). The program will keep a record of all the prizes he has won, the total worth of the prizes, and how much money he has spent. At any point, the program can print out these statistics.

The program will only handle ONE player at any one time. However, the player can be changed while the program is executing.

The Lucky Vending Machine begins with a welcome message followed by a menu with the following options :
Welcome to the Lucky Vending Machine
==============================
(1) Set Up New Player
(2) Guess A Prize
(3) What Have I Won So Far?
(4) Display Game Help
(5) Exit Game
Choose an option :

Option (1) asks the user to enter a name for the "player". The player’s name must not be blank. If this option is chosen again after a player has already been set up, a "new" player is created (ie. with a new name, no prizes, $0 spent). Note that the "new" player replaces the "old" player – ie. there is only ever one player at any one time.
Option (2) simulates a lucky guess operation. The computer generates a random number between 1-5. It then asks the player what prize he would like to win by trying to guess that number. The rules are :

Number Generated   Price Won   Price Worth  Cost to player
1                     Pen           $10           $1
2                     Book          $20           $2
3                     DVD           $30           $3
4                     Mouse         $40           $4
5                   Keyboard        $50           $5

If the player guesses wrongly, he wins no prize and loses the money ($1-5).
The "prizes" are simply implemented as Strings.
After each play, the computer records the player’s prize/worth/spending.
If the user enters a number which is less than 1, or more than 5, it should be rejected, and he does not lose any money.

Option (3) displays some statistics about the current player's prizes (and their worths) and total amount spent.

Option (4) displays some brief instructions regarding game play. It must at least inform the player of the rules of play (see prize table under Option (2) above)

Option (5) exits the program. All player statistics should be cleared.

The program has Game , Player and LuckyGuessGenerator
